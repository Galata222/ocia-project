            <p className="text-white f-16 mb-5 mt-4 animated fadeInDown wow" data-wow-delay=".2s">Founded in June 2022 by Wabi Mulata Dinsa, Warra Guddaa (meaning “Great Family”) reflects a fundamental belief: a family is truly great when its members support one another, regardless of differences. The Oromo people, as one family, embody this spirit of unity.

Growing up, my family used the term Warra Guddaa to describe the ways families support one another. Curious about its true meaning, I once asked my father, “What makes a family Warra Guddaa?” His response has guided me in establishing GOSA—the Great Oromo Support Association—where we come together to support one another, just as we did in our village.
